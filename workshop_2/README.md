# 2019 GitHub Workshops - Dundee University Computing Society
## Workshop 2

This workshop will focus on using continuous integration tools alongside gitHub. It was used to introduce coding environments for continuous integration for:
* HTML/CSS/JS (with Jekyll)
* PHP (with Microsoft Azure)
* Node (with Heroku)

Accompanying the lecture slides for this workshop are 3 other repositories that can be used as example (hopefully working) code for testing continuous integration options:

* HTML/CSS/JS with Jekyll: [Repository Link](https://github.com/mikecrabb/gitHubWorkshop_jekyll)
* PHP: [Repository Link](https://github.com/mikecrabb/gitHubWorkshop_php)
* Node: [Repository Link](https://github.com/mikecrabb/gitHubWorkshop_node)
